# Exploratory-analysis

4 R files and 4 PNG files are uploaded. They are for the course project 1 of the Exploratory Data Analysis course in Coursera. 

I tried several times with GitHub for windows and finally got these files uploaded. It seems that they show "reverse reverse".
---not sure what that means. But the files are uploaded and can be read now.
